# homebridge-bond-home

Homebridge implementation of the BOND Home v1 API originally by [@evandcoleman](https://github.com/evandcoleman). While this plugin is still a work in progress,one notable change is the implementation of multicast DNS service discovery for identifying BOND devices on the current network, rather than querying for them from the BOND API itself.
